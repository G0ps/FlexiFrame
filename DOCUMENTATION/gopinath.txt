Decide to work on react based , string to react component building

Future enhancements , make the React UI open for modification. Now its is not beign possible
to give codes on string , that can run loops so that the input is being manditory to maped using llm

to avoid that , need to figure out a sollution 

input -> llm (it samples input and builds a function that takes "actual input" as parameter) -> string -> json -> react_component
